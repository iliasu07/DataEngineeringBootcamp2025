Module 1 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp focuses on Containerization and Infrastructure as Code. The key components covered in this module include:
- **Introduction to GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**: Provides foundational knowledge of GCP, which is essential for the course.
- **Docker and docker-compose**: Introduces containerization concepts and how to use Docker to create and manage containers.
- **Running Postgres locally with Docker**: Teaches students how to set up a local PostgreSQL database using Docker.
- **Setting up infrastructure on GCP with Terraform**: Covers the use of Terraform for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Preparing the environment for the course**: Ensures that students have the necessary tools and setups in place to successfully participate in the course.
- **Homework**: Assignments to reinforce the concepts learned in the module.
The learning objectives of this module are to ensure students are comfortable using Docker and Terraform, understand the basics of cloud infrastructure, and are prepared to execute database operations locally. Deliverables typically include assignments and practical exercises related to the topics covered.
